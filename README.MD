Initial schematic and gerbers for a Gotek SFRC2D.B based on an Artery St32F415 chip.
Used photographs and a multimeter without removing any chips. Only removed RA/RB/RC to verify connections to U3.
Should work for the STM105 variant as some of the smoothing caps don't make sense for the Artery but do for the STM.
